# sqlMerge
#### I had the sudden need to merge data from identical SQL databases and I wanted to display the simplicity of python with a *no Frills* program

# WARNING! I AM NOT REPONSIBLE FOR LOST OR DAMAGED DATA

## Instructions:
- Take in 2 **IDENTICAL** SQLite 3 databases. *Read schema*
- *$ python3 sqlMerge.py*
- The prompt will ask for the first data base
	-- This will be the final product **BACK UP the original**
- The next prompt will ask for the db to be merged
- Success!
